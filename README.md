# EnviroMine ~~for Galaxy Odyssey~~ continuation
### based on [EnviroMine for Galaxy Odyssey](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs/enviromine-for-galaxy-odyssey) by [AstroTibs](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs)

## Differences from the Galaxy Odyssey version:

### 1) more sanity debuffs (due to the fact that sanity in the original enviromine does almost nothing dangerous (I plan to make it even more dangerous)

### 2) Compatible with hbm filters/masks/protective helmets (it will be right hnt, because Hbm’s Nuclear Tech, but it’s more convenient for me) (Test, no enviromine gas protection  yet)

### 3) Updated build script, thanks to GTNH!


## Current TODO:

### 1) implement death within a certain time when sanity = 0F

### 2) enviromine gas protection for  hbm filters/masks/protective helmets
